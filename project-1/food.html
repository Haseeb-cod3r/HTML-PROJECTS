        <h3>Chicken Karahi</h3>
    </a>

    <p>Chicken Karahi is a dish originating from the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent, and it's a staple
        in Pakistani cuisine. It's cooked in a karahi (a wok-like cooking vessel), which gives the dish its name.
        The chicken is cooked in a rich, tomato-based sauce with a blend of spices. The key to a good karahi is the
        use of fresh tomatoes and a generous amount of ginger and garlic. It's typically served with naan or roti
        and is known for its bold and spicy flavors.</p>

        <h3>Biryani</h3>
    </a>

    <p> Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its roots in the Mughal cuisine of India. It's a complex and aromatic
        dish, combining rice, meat (usually chicken, mutton, or beef), and a variety of spices. There are many
        regional variations of biryani, each with its own unique blend of flavors. Pakistani biryani, especially
        Sindhi and Hyderabadi biryanis, are known for their rich use of spices and aromatic basmati rice. The meat
        is often marinated and cooked separately before being layered with the rice and other ingredients. Biryani
        is a celebratory dish, often served at special occasions and festivals.</p>

        <h3> Nihari</h3>
    </a>

    <p> Nihari is a slow-cooked stew, traditionally made with beef or mutton, and it's considered a culinary
        treasure in Pakistan. It's a breakfast dish, often enjoyed with naan. The meat is cooked for several hours
        until it becomes incredibly tender and the broth develops a rich, gelatinous consistency. Nihari is flavored
        with a special blend of spices, including a unique nihari masala. It's a hearty and flavorful dish, perfect
        for a cold morning. It's a testament to the art of slow cooking and the rich culinary traditions of
        Pakistan.

        <h3>Chicken Tikka Masala</h3>
    </a>

    <p>While its exact origins are debated (some say it originated in a Glasgow, Scotland Indian restaurant),
        Chicken Tikka Masala is undeniably a beloved dish worldwide. It features marinated chicken pieces that are
        first grilled or baked, then added to a creamy, tomato-based sauce. The sauce is typically rich and
        flavorful, featuring a blend of spices like garam masala, coriander, and turmeric. It's often served with
        naan bread, perfect for soaking up the delicious sauce. In Pakistan, it's a popular restaurant dish and also
        made at home.</p>
